# deployed-from-codesandbox



This site was created using the React template from codesanbox.io then using their deploy to github functionality to generate the github page: 

https://julesofalltrades.github.io/deployed-from-codesandbox/


Hit one snag in this process: codesanbox generated a completely random name for the repo, less than desirable. Changing it in GitHub then breaks the GitHub page link for the repo.
